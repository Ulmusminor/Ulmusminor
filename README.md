## Hello, my name is Marco, nice to meet you!

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on three low priority projects:
- Developing a web for experiments with spider mites (which is being saved in Ulmusminor/smites).
- Investigating the impact of El NiÃ±o's climate effect over migratory aves.
- Translating Chess Evolved Online, a Steam game (https://store.steampowered.com/app/1064340/Chess_Evolved_Online/) to Spanish.

ðŸŒ± I'm working on solving Project Euler problems daily! My account is pRunus!
